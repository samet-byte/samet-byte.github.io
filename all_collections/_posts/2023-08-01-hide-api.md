### First its needed to state that we are going to use build configuration.




```groovy
android {
// .. Usual stuff

buildFeatures {buildConfig true}
}
```
```Kotlin
android {
// .. Usual stuff

buildFeatures {buildConfig = true}
}

```




### Then we are ready to state our variable(s)


```groovy

Properties properties 

```
