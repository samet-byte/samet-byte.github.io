🌌 Interstellar Scholar in Disguise: Basically, I'm a fancy space student pretending to blend in on Earth.

🌍 Amateur Earthling: I'm still figuring out how this whole "Earthling" thing works – gravity is a tough subject! 

🚶‍♂️ Flâneur: I roam around like a philosopher, but with less thinking and more wandering. 

Previous Life Experinces:

🦥 Sloth Sensei of Efficiency: 
I've perfected the art of getting things done with minimal effort, just like a sloth reaching for that perfectly placed leaf. 🍃⏰ 

Skills & Interests:

💻 Non-hooded IT guy:
- Java / Kotlin (Android) :  Enough to confuse the bugs and make them question their existence.
- Python, MATLAB: Proficient enough to make the bugs second-guess their career choices.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Just enough to create websites that might leave users questioning their sanity.
- Swift, C, C++: Enough to make an app that crashes with elegance and flair.
- Unofficial Google Sheets Wizard: Pivot tables, VLOOKUPs, IF statements: Can turn a spreadsheet into a API and work of art that baffles even mathematicians.


📱 Android (Java / Kotlin) Aficionado:
-I speak Android fluently, but don't worry, I don't expect my phone to answer back... yet.
- My code is so clean that even Marie Kondo would be proud.
🔍 Research Wrangler:
- I dive into research like a penguin into a fish buffet, always hungry for knowledge.
- Rumor has it I once found the solution before the problem finished explaining itself.
🚀 App-launch Extraordinaire:
- I launch apps smoother than a penguin sliding on ice – no slipping allowed.
- My apps are so intuitive that even my grandma could use them. (And trust me, she's still trying to figure out how to turn on her TV.)
🕵️ Debugging Detective:
- I find bugs faster than a cat finds a sunbeam. They don't stand a chance.
- Sometimes, I suspect bugs leave my code just to avoid the embarrassment.
🧠 Brainstorming Wizard:
- I brainstorm ideas like a caffeinated squirrel on a mission – fast and full of surprises.
- My ideas are so innovative that they once left a room speechless, which was impressive considering it was a virtual meeting.
🏆 Achievements:
- Once fixed a bug so elusive that it was awarded an honorary detective badge.
- Wrote code so efficient that it once made a robot shed a tear of joy.

  
🛋️ Master of Procrastination:
- Black Belt in "Last-Minute Panic."
- PhD in "Productive Distractions."

🤹‍♂️📚💻 Certified Multitasker:
- Can juggle programming, snacking, and binge-watching seamlessly. Don't ask about the number of remote controls lost in the process.

☕🧠🐿️ Previous Experience:
- Part-time Mind Reader: Guessed what the user wanted before they even finished typing.
- Freelance Procrastination Consultant: Helped clients put off tasks so effectively that they achieved a Zen-like state of not caring.

🎶🤯🎻 Argument Escalation Specialist:
- Elevated debates to an art form. (Not kidding.) Can turn "Is cereal a soup?" into an international summit. (Just can't proof.)

🤟 Amateur Sign Language Interpreter:
My sign language skills are not perfect but enough to understand the basic needs, though my signing is a bit like Sisyphus pushing that boulder – a bit wobbly but determined! 


📚 Existentialist Word Weaver and Honorary Member of Dead Poets Society:
I ponder life's mysteries through the lens of existentialism – like Sisyphus rolling his boulder uphill, only to have it roll back down. But hey, at least he had a great workout routine! 💪🏔️

🎬 Cinema Geek Extraordinaire:
If cinema were a religion, I'd be its most devout disciple. I analyze movies with the intensity of a detective solving a case, and my movie quotes are as on point as a laser-guided missile.

🏀 Former 15-Minute Basketball Star:
In my basketball career, I experienced 15 minutes of fame in Türk Telekom Junior Team – 10 minutes on the bench and 5 minutes on the court. It was a slam dunk in the art of warm-up exercises!

⚽ Turkish Football Federation Licenced Referee (for 1 Day):
I tried my hand at refereeing – my decisions were as questionable as a plot twist in a B-grade movie. Let's just say, the players weren't the only ones confused on the field.

♟️ Former Chess & Orienteering Enthusiast:
Chess is like a battle of wits, and orienteering is like a treasure hunt where the treasure moves around. I excelled at neither – my chess pieces played hopscotch, and I think I ended up finding Narnia during orienteering.

🧬 Biotechnology Cloning Program Participant (Just a bacteria gene, or is it?):
I took part in a genetics cloning program. Sure, it was just bacteria, but who knows? Maybe there's a microscopic army of me out there, plotting a takeover of the petri dish.


🌟🏆 Achievements:
- Found the end of the internet, but it was just a cat video loop.
- Successfully explained complex quantum physics using only emojis and piece of orange.
- Managed to balance a spoon on my nose for a record-breaking 2.5 seconds.

🦥 Summary for Sloths:
In the grand theater of life, I've embraced my roles like a method actor immerses in a character. And just like Sisyphus, I keep pushing forward, whether it's a boulder or the play button on my favorite movie. So, if you're in need of an Android virtuoso who can code with elegance and conquer research challenges with a wink, you've found your developer. Just be warned: my apps might be so addictive that you'll forget to feed your pet rock! Also, if you're in need of a professional wanderer who can confuse bugs, create websites with questionable design choices, and turn any argument into an epic showdown, I'm your go-to person. Just don't ask me to find my keys – that's a task even Sherlock Holmes would find baffling.
